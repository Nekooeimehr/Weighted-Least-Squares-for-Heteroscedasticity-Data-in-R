# Weighted Least Squares for Heteroscedasticity Data in R
Heteroscedasticity is a major concern in linear regression models which violates the assumption that the model residuals have a constant variance and are uncorrelated. While the Ordinary (Gaussian) Least Squares (OLS) model is an unbiased estimator for this scenario, it is yet insufficient because the correct variance and covariance are not considered. 

A short report is provided in the repository which explains about the problem and how to handle it using weighted least squares. The source code for plotting the data and addressing the problem is also provided in the repository.
